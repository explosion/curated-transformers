It has a similar architecture to NLTKâ€™s, but is designed from the ground up for the needs of a NLP research community rather than a production system: It has a smaller and less mature API, does away with its core tokenizer (which is notoriously hard to train), and is based on the Speller system from Stanford's CS-ADLDN program, which has been shown to significantly outperform the NLTK tokeniser in terms of both accuracy (93.7% on a test set of 20K tokens vs. NLTK's 76.3%) and efficiency.\n\n",
