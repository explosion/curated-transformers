Deployment
==========

In many cases, a PyTorch model can be deployed directly in a Python application,
e.g., in a `Flask-based REST service
<https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/flask_rest_api_tutorial.html>`_. In
other cases, such as deployment to non-CUDA accelerators, additional model
transformations might be needed. On this page, we cover several deployment
scenarios in the future.
